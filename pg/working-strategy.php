Using the information obtained from you during the planning phase, we commence the layout design process with sitemaps before moving on to wireframes and drawings.

Depending on the client's requests, software requirements, and server restrictions, this procedure is typically the most individualized. Our sites will always be compatible with a selection of modern and, more significantly, ancient browsers. We attempt to support two IE versions prior to the most recent version. Unfortunately, we cannot support very ancient browsers without sacrificing newer features, which is why it is crucial to identify your users during the discovery phase. Once the CMS is complete, we will upload the images, visuals, and text that you have provided.</h5>

We outline a plan for transferring the website to the final web server and ensuring that the domain and DNS (Domain Name System) strategy has been managed and set up per the discovery phase's specifications. To transfer a new site, which is typically on the live server prior to launch, we simply send traffic to the server on the 'live date'. Typically, for redesigns, we remove the old code from the live server and deploy the new code. This transition can be completed in just a few minutes with proper planning, minimizing delay.</h5>
