          <p>Undoubtedly, the most important part of any application is the user experience. Whether the person using a service is an internal business user, external partner or end consumer, someone is always on the other side of the screen. Each individual's experience with the application largely dictates its success. User Experience encompasses much more than a site's usability, though it is often confused with User Interface.
            <br><br>A User Interface is a point of interaction and a means of communication between a person and system. Interfaces are a mere subset of the greater User Experience. <?= $Company["name"]; ?> uses industry-best practices for both UX and UI and has developed a set of internal tools to help apply them to clients' projects.

          <p>User Experience Design and User Interface Design are two of the most essential skill-sets for distinguishing a mobile or web application from the competition. In a multitude of software products competing for users’ attention, ensuring your designs are intuitive, compelling, and memorable makes all the difference.</p>

          <p>Our expert designers are well-versed in app and web design standards and best practices, and implement this knowledge to every assignment.</p>

          <p>We'll quickly move from concept to prototype in order to ensure that the next iteration is just around the corner. Our process involves learning about your project, company, team and users so that we can create the best experience for everyone using the product.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align:center;">UX Design</h4>
                <p>UX, or ‘User Experience,’ is what guides users’ actions to the intended objective. We frequently refer to this as the "flow" of the user through the application's features.</p>
                <p>Research on what types of users you’re targeting with your software product (referred to as ‘User Personas’), our client’s knowledge of the industry they are looking to serve, and our team’s deep understanding of modern design best-practices, are all combined to form a compelling interface that ‘clicks’ in the minds of the app’s user base.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align:center;">User flow diagrams.</h4>
                <p>Our graphic designers are specialists in conceptualizing thoughtful interfaces for iPhone apps, Android apps, and mobile-responsive web products. Foundational to this effort is the preparation of a User Flow Diagram as a first step of our process.</p>

                <p>User Flow Diagrams map out the logic of how a user might interact with each screen, or page, of the software system. A goal in every app is to minimize the number of clicks, or taps, that are required for a user to reach the feature that they are looking for. Understanding the flow of your app will ensure it is robust yet simple to navigate, keeping users engaged rather than driving them away in frustration.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align:center;">UI design.</h4>
                <p>User Interface Design breathes life into your app or website idea. Instead of just talking about your concept, you’ll now be able to share visuals that show precisely what each screen, or page, of the product looks like.</p>

                <p>This is one of the most important steps of building a new digital product - as this is a large part of the impression your product will leave on your users. You’ll need a graphic design team on your side that understands the principles of modern UI Design and can apply these best practices to your feature set.</p>

                <p>App and web prototyping (invision) After wrapping up the UI Design of each of your app or website’s screens, <?= $Company["name"] ?>'s' graphic artists will utilize the Invision platform to prepare a navigable prototype of your product. This shows exactly how each screen looks, feels, and functions - and can even be installed on your phone or sent via link to investors (for fundraising), future users (for feedback and concept validation), or stakeholders (for buy-in) prior to jumping into Development.</p>

                <p>App and web prototyping serves as a valuable ‘pausing point’ to ensure you’re building the right thing, securing buy-in from future users and stakeholders while the feature set is still easy to manipulate and iterate on.</p>

                <p>Partnering with <?= $Company["name"] ?>'s' means quality, value, and attentiveness that has earned us the title of top-rated app and web design firm in the Southeast. Schedule a call with us today to discuss your project..</p>
